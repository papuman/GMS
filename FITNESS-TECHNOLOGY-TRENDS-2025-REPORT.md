Focus on Tier 1 essentials first, differentiate with Tier 2 features, and ignore the hype around crypto, blockchain, and bleeding-edge AI that lacks proven ROI.

The fitness technology market is real, growing fast, and ready for innovative solutions that deliver tangible value to gym operators and members alike.

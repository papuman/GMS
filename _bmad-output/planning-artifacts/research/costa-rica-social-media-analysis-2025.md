- Minimal online presence
- Traditional operations

**Target Market Profile:**
- 50-200 members (estimated based on pricing/hours)

2. **Simple, affordable pricing** (₡15,000-20,000/month)
3. **Easy to learn** (not tech-savvy owners)

**Competitive Advantage:**

- Operating 17 hours/day = active business
- Student discounts = community engagement
- Puriscal location = gyms exist beyond San José

### WHAT THEY'RE GETTING NOW:

1. **Buggy apps from LatinSoft** (crashes, broken features)
2. **Language barriers from Smart Fit** (Portuguese-only)
3. **Hidden fees** (24/7 Fitness $2.50 surprise charges)
4. **Account blocking errors** (Smart Fit payment issues)
5. **App-only booking** (fails when app crashes)

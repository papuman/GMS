### Critical Industry Shift: ANT+ to Bluetooth Transition

**Major Announcement:**

[Garmin's recent announcement to discontinue ANT+ membership and certification programs by June 2025](https://watchesreviewed.com/death_of_ant_plus/) marks a pivotal shift in the landscape of wireless communication for fitness and cycling devices. [Driven by EU encryption regulations and the rise of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ANT+ is becoming obsolete](https://watchesreviewed.com/death_of_ant_plus/), forcing athletes and manufacturers to transition to BLE-based ecosystems.

**Reason for Change:**

[The core reason for this change is the European Union's Radio Equipment Directive (EU RED)](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/the-begining-of-the-end-for-ant-wireless.html), which will take full effect next summer. That directive requires [authentication and encryption for wireless communications of personal information](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/the-begining-of-the-end-for-ant-wireless.html). While [ANT+ has long offered the ability to authenticate and encrypt data streams, it hasn't been implemented in common profiles like heart rate or cycling power](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/the-begining-of-the-end-for-ant-wireless.html). [Garmin says that to do so going forward would effectively break backward compatibility](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/the-begining-of-the-end-for-ant-wireless.html).

**Impact on Gym Equipment:**

[ANT+ enabled gym equipment, such as treadmills and indoor bikes, to sync with wearables](https://watchesreviewed.com/death_of_ant_plus/). However, [BLE's dominance has shifted manufacturers' priorities. Brands like Peloton and Technogym now favor BLE, making ANT+ an increasingly niche feature](https://watchesreviewed.com/death_of_ant_plus/).

[G.FIT is a turnkey dual-protocol ANT/Bluetooth® low energy technology (BLE) solution](https://www.thisisant.com/developer/components/gfit) for wireless fitness equipment and smart bike trainers, optimized for group and classroom training applications.

**Technology Comparison:**

[Deciding between Bluetooth and ANT comes down to priorities: ANT excels in advanced data sharing, while Bluetooth integrates seamlessly with popular fitness platforms](https://stormotion.io/blog/ant-bluetooth/). [BLE now allows up to seven simultaneous connections](https://peteorganics.com/blogs/news/blueooth-vs-ant-for-cyclists), matching ANT+ in multi-device functionality while integrating seamlessly with smartphones, earbuds, and other consumer electronics.

**Strategic Implication:**

The industry is clearly transitioning toward **Bluetooth-only solutions for 2025 and beyond**. GMS should focus exclusively on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for all equipment integrations, as ANT+ support is being phased out industry-wide.

### General Fitness Technology Adoption

**Technology Usage in Gyms:**

- [Digital check-ins and online bookings are adopted by 69% of gyms](https://wod.guru/blog/gym-membership-statistics/)
- [Over 60% of gym members use some form of fitness tracker during their workouts](https://wod.guru/blog/gym-membership-statistics/)
- [25% of gyms now incorporate AI and machine learning technologies for personalized workout plans](https://wod.guru/blog/gym-membership-statistics/)

**Member Behavior:**

- [75% of gym users also utilize online fitness classes](https://www.exercise.com/grow/gym-membership-statistics/)
- [About 40% of gym-goers express interest in holistic health services provided by their fitness centers](https://financesonline.com/gym-membership-statistics/)

### MQTT Protocol for IoT Equipment

**Protocol Overview:**

[MQTT (formerly "Message Queuing Telemetry Transport") is the de facto data exchange protocol for IoT messaging, standardized by OASIS and ISO](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/what-is-the-mqtt-protocol), providing a scalable and reliable way to connect devices over the Internet. It is [designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth](https://mqtt.org/).

**Real-Time Data Streaming:**

[MQTT is designed for low-latency real-time messaging, with messages delivered immediately rather than using scheduled polling](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt/). [MQTT is optimal for streaming data to and from edge nodes, where real-time metrics are published from nearby equipment to edge gateways](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/building-industrial-iot-data-streaming-architecture-mqtt/).

**IoT Architecture Benefits:**

[By combining event-driven architecture with MQTT's lightweight, publish-subscribe model, manufacturers can create modular systems that are easier to maintain, faster to scale, and capable of delivering real-time insights across the enterprise](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/building-industrial-iot-data-streaming-architecture-mqtt/).

There is a [growing trend for enterprise-level Internet of Things (IoT) applications requiring real-time horizontally scalable data processing platforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03997), with real-time processing platforms receiving data streams from sensor networks (e.g., autonomous and connected vehicles, smart security for businesses and homes, smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other wearables) requiring distributed MQTT brokers.

**Technical Efficiency:**

[IoT devices are often constrained in terms of processing power, memory, and energy consumption; MQTT's minimal overhead and small packet size make it ideal for these devices](https://www.alotceriot.com/what-is-mqtt-messaging-protocol-iot/), with [studies showing that MQTT requires up to 80% less network bandwidth than HTTP for transmitting the same amount of data](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt).

**Gym Equipment Use Cases:**

- **Cardio machines** publishing real-time heart rate, power, RPM to central dashboard
- **Strength equipment** logging rep counts, weight settings, time under tension
- **Group fitness classes** aggregating performance data from 20-50 participants simultaneously
- **Equipment maintenance** monitoring usage hours, calibration alerts, error codes

**Strategic Insight:** MQTT's 80% bandwidth efficiency and pub/sub model make it ideal for real-time gym equipment dashboards and multi-device tracking scenarios.

[TCX is similar to GPX since it exchanges GPS tracks, but treats a track as an Activity rather than simply a series of GPS points](https://medium.com/decathlondigital/gpx-tcx-fit-how-to-choose-the-best-file-extension-for-sport-activity-transfer-403487337c04), and provides [standards for transferring heart rate, running cadence, bicycle cadence, and calories](https://medium.com/decathlondigital/gpx-tcx-fit-how-to-choose-the-best-file-extension-for-sport-activity-transfer-403487337c04).

**Specifications:**
- [Garmin created the TCX format, and the schema is versioned and publicly maintained](https://blog.concannon.tech/tech-talk/gps-activity-data-file-types/)
- XML-based (human-readable)
- Larger file sizes than FIT

**Use Case:** Structured workout activities with heart rate and cadence data

---

**FIT (Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer):**

[FIT protocol is a format designed specifically for storing and sharing data from sport, fitness and health devices](https://medium.com/decathlondigital/gpx-tcx-fit-how-to-choose-the-best-file-extension-for-sport-activity-transfer-403487337c04), allowing you to [store sensor data, course points, workout instructions, device settings, etc](https://medium.com/decathlondigital/gpx-tcx-fit-how-to-choose-the-best-file-extension-for-sport-activity-transfer-403487337c04).

**Key Advantages:**
- [FIT files are the smallest files containing a full set of workout data](https://medium.com/decathlondigital/gpx-tcx-fit-how-to-choose-the-best-file-extension-for-sport-activity-transfer-403487337c04)
- Binary encoded (not human-readable but extremely efficient)
- [The format is defined, owned, and maintained by Garmin](https://blog.concannon.tech/tech-talk/gps-activity-data-file-types/)
- [Garmin, Strava, Polar, Suunto and more now use FIT format](https://blog.concannon.tech/tech-talk/gps-activity-data-file-types/)

**File Size Comparison:**
[For the same route, a FIT file was 254 KB while a TCX file was 3,496 KB](https://medium.com/decathlondigital/gpx-tcx-fit-how-to-choose-the-best-file-extension-for-sport-activity-transfer-403487337c04) - **93% smaller!**

**Industry Recommendation:**

[FIT is the preferable format, as TCX doesn't support all metadata and GPX is even worse in that aspect](https://www.cyclinganalytics.com/blog/2013/06/supported-file-formats).

**GMS Strategic Decision:**

- **Import Support:** Accept all three formats (GPX, TCX, FIT) for maximum compatibility
- **Export Priority:** Use FIT format as primary export for efficiency
- **API Integration:** Prioritize FIT file generation for equipment data exports
- **Storage Optimization:** FIT's 93% size reduction critical for cloud storage costs at scale

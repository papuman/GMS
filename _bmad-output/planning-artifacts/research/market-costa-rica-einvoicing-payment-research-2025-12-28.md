## Customer Insights

### Customer Behavior Patterns

**E-Invoicing Adoption and Usage**

Costa Rica demonstrates mature electronic invoicing adoption with **over 130,000 taxpayers** actively using the system since the 2018 mandatory implementation. The scaled mass adoption program that began in 2017 has resulted in widespread acceptance across business segments.

**Version 4.4 Transition (September 2025)**

On September 1, 2025, version 4.4 became mandatory, with **over 450,000 taxpayers required to migrate**. This represents a 346% increase from the original 130,000 users, indicating significant expansion of the e-invoicing mandate to cover previously exempt businesses and economic sectors.

**Payment Method Preferences - SINPE Móvil Dominance**

Costa Rican customers show overwhelming preference for SINPE Móvil, with:
- **3 million users and 4 million accounts** by mid-2024
- **76% of Costa Ricans aged 15+** actively using the system
- **84% of those with bank accounts** are active SINPE Móvil users
- **Transaction volumes surged 200%** since 2020
- **80% of all interbank transfers** use SINPE Móvil
- **40% of retail transactions** now mobile-based

The dramatic shift from cash is evident: In 2019, households performed 155 million ATM transactions and only 6 million SINPE Móvil payments. By 2023, these figures shifted to 104 million ATM transactions and **506 million SINPE Móvil payments**.

**E-Commerce and Digital Payment Growth**

Costa Rica leads Central America in e-commerce with:
- **$6.4 billion in sales volume (2024)**, growing at **13% CAGR to $9.3 billion by 2027**
- **74% of e-commerce volume from mobile devices** (2024)
- **Digital payments market: $8.99 billion (2025)**, projected to reach **$21.08 billion by 2029** (23.75% annual growth)
- **Mobile POS payments: $5.43 billion** market segment in 2025

**Integration Mandates**

A critical behavioral requirement emerged in v4.4: **SINPE Móvil transaction identification is now mandatory on invoices**, allowing the tax administration to cross-check transactions and detect under-invoicing. This creates a compliance-driven behavior where businesses must integrate payment method tracking directly into invoicing workflows.

### Pain Points and Challenges

**Version 4.4 Migration Complexity**

The September 2025 transition introduced **over 146 changes** to the invoicing landscape, creating significant operational burden:

- **Technological upgrades required**: Companies must update invoicing systems, train staff, and integrate e-invoicing with internal accounting systems
- **Timeline pressure**: Implementation was postponed to September 1, 2025, after which version 4.3 was repealed, forcing rapid migration
- **Penalty risk**: Businesses face **2% of prior month's turnover** in penalties for non-compliant e-invoices

**New Documentation Requirements for SMEs**

Small and medium enterprises face expanded compliance obligations:

- **Foreign vendor purchases**: SMEs acquiring software, digital licenses, consulting services, accommodations, or travel tickets from foreign vendors must issue an **electronic purchase invoice** with VAT through reverse-charge mechanism
- **End of informal documentation**: SMEs can no longer leave common purchases unsupported; each expense must be electronically documented with VAT
- **Immediate operational adjustment required**

_Source: [Auxadi - Electronic Invoicing Format 4.4](https://www.auxadi.com/blog/2025/07/18/costa-rica-electronic-invoicing-format/)_

**Classification Code Changes**

Starting **October 6, 2025**, **CIIU 4 codes became mandatory** for all invoices under version 4.4, requiring businesses to:
- Update classification systems
- Recode existing product catalogs
- Ensure proper economic activity classification

_Source: [PROCOM - Version 4.4 Updates](https://www.procom.cr/en/nueva-version-4-4-de-la-facturacion-electronica-en-costa-rica/)_

**Additional Monthly Reporting Burden**

In **November 2025**, Costa Rica's General Directorate of Taxes introduced a **new monthly reporting obligation** for transactions not covered by the electronic invoicing system, requiring all businesses to submit detailed monthly reports.

_Source: [Sovos - Changes in Electronic Receipt Regulations](https://sovos.com/blog/vat/changes-in-electronic-receipt-regulations-in-costa-rica/)_

**Tax Deductibility Risk**

Expenses not backed by compliant e-invoices are **not deductible for income tax purposes**, creating financial risk for businesses with incomplete or non-compliant invoicing systems.

_Source: [TicosLand - E-Invoicing Rules](https://ticosland.com/costa-ricas-new-e-invoicing-rules-shake-up-smes/)_

**Cash Flow Disruption**

Businesses must adapt quickly to avoid:
- Invoice rejections
- Disruptions to cash flow
- Delayed payments due to non-compliant documents

_Source: [Auxadi - Electronic Invoicing Format 4.4](https://www.auxadi.com/blog/2025/07/18/costa-rica-electronic-invoicing-format/)_

### Decision-Making Processes

**Regulatory Compliance as Primary Driver**

Costa Rican businesses select e-invoicing systems primarily based on **mandatory compliance requirements**:

- **XML v4.4 format support** based on national standard with 140+ technical and fiscal changes
- **Mandatory digital signatures** for invoice authentication
- **Submission capability** via Comprobantes Electrónicos system
- **5-year archiving requirement** for all electronic documents

**ERP Integration Priority**

After compliance, businesses prioritize **seamless ERP integration**:

**Document Type Versatility**

Systems must support multiple electronic document types in XML format:
- Electronic invoice (FE)
- Purchase electronic invoice
- Export electronic invoice
- Electronic credit and debit notes (NC/ND)
- Electronic ticket (TE)
- **Electronic Payment Receipt (REP)** - new in v4.4 for credit-based sales

_Source: [Fonoa - Practical Guide to E-invoicing](https://www.fonoa.com/resources/blog/practical-guide-to-e-invoicing-in-costa-rica)_

**Storage and Security Requirements**

Businesses evaluate providers based on:
- **5-year storage compliance** in original XML format
- **Accessibility at all times**
- **Data integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality**
- **Protection against unauthorized access, modification, or deletion**

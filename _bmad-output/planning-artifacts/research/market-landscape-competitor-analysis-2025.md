- **Global Market Size:** $400M+ annually, growing at 12-15% CAGR
- **Pricing Gap:** US platforms charge $129-599/month; CR market can support $50-150/month
- **Critical Tipping Point:** 40-80 members is when manual systems fail and gym owners seek software
- **Winner-Take-Most:** Platforms with bundled mobile app + payment processing + access control dominate

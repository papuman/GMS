## 5. PRICING MODELS & DECISION-MAKING

### 5.1 Per-Member vs Flat-Rate Comparison

**Per-Member Pricing:**

**How it works:** $2-8 per active member/month

**Examples:**
- WodGuru: **$1/member**, max $119
- Industry typical: **$2-8/member**

**Advantages:**
- Lower initial cost for new gyms
- Pay only for active members
- Scales with actual usage

**Disadvantages:**
- **Unpredictable costs** as membership grows
- Can "balloon" expenses rapidly
- Harder to budget long-term

> "Works well when you're small, but expenses can balloon as you expand"

> "For gyms under 100 members, flat-rate or free software is usually the most cost-effective, since pay-per-member plans can add up quickly as you grow"

*Source: [Recess](https://www.recess.tv/blog-posts/gym-management-software-pricing-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know), [StudioGrowth](https://studiogrowth.com/fitness-studio-software-pricing-guide/)*

**Flat-Rate Pricing:**

**How it works:** Fixed monthly fee regardless of member count

**Examples:**
- Gymdesk: **$75-$200/month** by member tier
- TeamUp: **$99-$189/month** by member tier
- Zen Planner: **$99+/month**

**Advantages:**
- **Predictable costs** for budgeting
- No surprises as membership grows
- Better for scaling gyms

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher upfront cost for small gyms
- Pay same price even with fewer members

> "Predictable costs regardless of member count. Easy to budget for, but starting prices can be higher"

> "Better for growing gyms with expanding membership bases"

*Source: [Recess](https://www.recess.tv/blog-posts/gym-management-software-pricing-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know)*

### 5.2 Tiered Pricing Models

**Common Structure:**
- **Entry/Starter:** $50-$100/month (basic features, up to 50-100 members)
- **Standard/Pro:** $100-$200/month (full features, up to 200 members)
- **Premium/Enterprise:** $200-$500+/month (advanced features, unlimited members)

**Psychological Impact:**

> "Using psychological pricing, such as ending gym membership prices at '.99' or offering tiered pricing with a clear 'best value' option, leverages consumer behavior and perception to increase sales"

*Source: [WodGuru](https://wod.guru/blog/gym-pricing-strategy/)*

**Decision Factors:**

> "Each model has pros and cons. The right fit depends on your size, budget, and growth plans"

> "Essential features are often locked behind higher-priced tiers"

*Source: [Recess](https://www.recess.tv/blog-posts/gym-management-software-pricing-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know)*

### 5.3 Free with Transaction Fees

**Model:**
- **$0/month** base subscription
- **2-4% + $0.30** per transaction

**Examples:**
- SimpleGym Free: **1% + base ACH/credit card rates**
- PushPress Free: **4.19% + $0.30** (credit card), **2.09% + $0.30** (ACH)
- Recess: **$0/month**, funded through payment processing

**Best for:**
- Gyms accepting <$15,000/month in payments
- New gyms with <100 members
- Gyms wanting to test software

**Break-even Analysis:**
- At $20,000/month revenue with 2.5% fee = **$500/month**
- Often more expensive than flat-rate at scale

### 5.4 Price Anchoring & Psychology

**Tiered Memberships:**
> "Members feel their needs and desires are being uniquely catered to through customizable options"

**Bundling:**
> "Members often perceive bundled services as a better value"

**Social Motivation:**
> "Group memberships increase motivation and commitment, leading to higher retention rates"

**Low-Barrier Entry:**
> "Pay-per-class appeals to those hesitant about long-term financial commitments"

- $200-$500: Feature overload, unnecessary complexity for 50-150 member gyms

- $99-$149/month
- Full member management
- Branded mobile app included
- Marketing automation (email/SMS)
- Basic reporting
- No hidden fees or add-ons

- Biometric-driven workout recommendations
- Recovery monitoring and rest day suggestions
- Performance tracking and PR celebrations
- Gamification based on real fitness data

#### **Community Features**

**Current State:** Minimal (PushPress has community board)

**Opportunity:**
- Member-to-member messaging
- Workout buddy matching
- Social feed with achievements
- Challenges and leaderboards
- User-generated content (workout tips)

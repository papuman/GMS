## Offline Mode

### What Happens When Internet Goes Down?

✅ **POS keeps working** - No interruption
✅ **Sales process normally** - Just click as usual
✅ **Invoices queued** - Stored locally
✅ **Auto-sync later** - When internet returns

### How to Know You're Offline?

Look for: **⚠ Sin Conexión** (top-right, red)

### Queue Counter

```
⚠ Sin Conexión | Cola Offline: 3 facturas
```

This means 3 invoices waiting to send to Hacienda.

**Don't worry!** They'll send automatically when online.

1. **Member ID** - Instant, unique

3. **Last Name** - Quick, may have duplicates
   - Example: `Rodriguez`

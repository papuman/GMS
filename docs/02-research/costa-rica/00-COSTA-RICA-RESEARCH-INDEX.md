## 🗂️ Research Structure

This hub organizes Costa Rica research into **3 complementary domains**:

```
DOMAIN 1: PROVIDER LANDSCAPE ← Market intelligence, competitive analysis
    └─ Who are the players? How do they compete? What's the market structure?

DOMAIN 2: MIGRATION BEST PRACTICES ← Technical implementation guidance
    └─ How do gyms migrate from old systems? What are the technical requirements?

DOMAIN 3: COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS ← Legal and regulatory mandate
s
    └─ What does the law require? What are the penalties? What must be implemented?
```

**Critical Migration Requirement: Consecutive Numbering** ⚠️

**The Law:**
When a business switches e-invoicing providers, they **MUST continue** their consecutive invoice numbering from the last number used. They **CANNOT** restart at 1.

**20-Digit Consecutive Structure:**
```
AAA-BBBBB-CC-DDDDDDDDDD
│   │     │  └─ Consecutive number (10 digits): 0000000001 to 9999999999
│   │     └─ Document type (2 digits): 01=Invoice, 02=Debit, 03=Credit, 04=Ticket
│   └─ Terminal/point-of-sale (5 digits): 00001 to 99999
└─ Establishment/branch (3 digits): 001 to 999

Example: 001-00001-01-0000000152
         Branch 1, Terminal 1, Invoice type, Invoice #152
```

**Migration Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Consecutive Handling | Special Requirements |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **First-time (from paper)** | Start at 00000000001 | Register in ATV/OVI portal first |
| **Switching providers** | Continue from last number | Must know exact last number used |
| **Adding new branch/terminal** | New branch starts at 00000000001 | Branch code differs (002, 003, etc.) |
| **Reached max (9,999,999,999)** | Can restart at 00000000001 | Extremely rare case |
| **Version 4.3 to 4.4** | Continue same sequence | Add provider field to XML |

**Critical Migration Risks:**

**HIGH RISK:**
- ⚠️ **Duplicate consecutive numbers** → Invoice REJECTED by Hacienda
- ⚠️ **Invalid digital certificate** → Cannot submit invoices
- ⚠️ **Version mismatch** → Non-compliance with v4.4

**MEDIUM RISK:**
- ⚠️ **Customer confusion** → Communication plan needed
- ⚠️ **Rejected invoices** → User error during setup
- ⚠️ **Data quality issues** → Clean import data first

**LOW RISK:**
- ⚠️ **PDF formatting** → Cosmetic issues only
- ⚠️ **Timezone issues** → Usually auto-handled

**Implementation Code Pattern:**
```python
# Consecutive number management for Costa Rica
consecutive_sequences = {
    '01': {'last_used': 152, 'next': 153},      # Invoices (Facturas)
    '02': {'last_used': 8, 'next': 9},          # Debit Notes
    '03': {'last_used': 45, 'next': 46},        # Credit Notes
    '04': {'last_used': 2340, 'next': 2341},    # Tickets (Tiquetes)
    '05': {'last_used': 0, 'next': 1},          # Export Invoices
    # ... other document types
}

def get_next_consecutive(establishment, terminal, doc_type):
    """
    Generate next consecutive number for invoice
    Must be atomic to prevent duplicates
    """
    sequence_key = f"{establishment}-{terminal}-{doc_type}"

    with transaction.atomic():
        sequence = ConsecutiveSequence.objects.select_for_update().get(
            establishment=establishment,
            terminal=terminal,
            doc_type=doc_type
        )
        next_number = sequence.last_used + 1
        sequence.last_used = next_number
        sequence.save()

    return f"{establishment}-{terminal}-{doc_type}-{next_number:010d}"
```

**GMS Migration Wizard Design:**

**Step 1: Detect Migration Type**
```
Are you:
○ New to electronic invoicing (select if first time)
○ Switching from another provider (select if migrating)
```

**Step 2: If Switching - Gather Last Consecutive**
```
Enter your LAST invoice number from your previous provider:

Establishment: [001] ▼
Terminal: [00001] ▼
Document Type: [01 - Invoice] ▼
Last Number Used: [_______152]

Preview: 001-00001-01-0000000152

Next invoice will be: 001-00001-01-0000000153
```

**Step 3: Lock Consecutive (Anti-Tampering)**
```
⚠️ WARNING: Once confirmed, consecutive numbers CANNOT be changed
This prevents accidental duplicates which Hacienda will REJECT.

[x] I confirm the last invoice number is correct
[ Confirm and Lock Consecutive Numbers ]
```

**Step 4: Audit Trail**
```
✅ Consecutive numbers configured
✅ Audit log created
✅ System locked for tampering
✅ Ready to generate invoices

Migration completed successfully!
```
